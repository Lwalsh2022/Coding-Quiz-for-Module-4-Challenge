# Coding Quiz for Module 4 Challenge




## Inspiration

For README: This challenge was to create a coding assessment that is timed. The assessment should deduct time for a wrong answer (I didn't figure that out) and allow you to save the initials for a high score. (Ran out of time)


## Usage




## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
